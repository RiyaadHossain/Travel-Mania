            I am Riyad Hossain and I want to be a Full-stack Web Application
            Developer. To achieve my goal of being a Web Application Developer,
            I work approximately 8-9 hours regularly.
            <br />
            <br />I possess certain soft skills such as firm determination, deep
            focus, persistency, hard work, and consistency to succeed in my
            career. These skills help me a lot to avoid failure whenever I start
            building any project. Moreover, I don't give up even if I get any
            errors while coding. Rather, I read the error message and try to
            carefully fix the error by observing my code. Also, I search on
            Google whenever I can't resolve my code bug on my own. This is how I
            work to accomplish my goal. ðŸ™‚
